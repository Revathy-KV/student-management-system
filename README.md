# student-management-system
A Flask-based Student Management System implementing CRUD operations with a clean HTML interface for managing student records.

Project Overview

The Student Management System is a web-based application developed using Python Flask that enables efficient management of student records.
This project implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through a simple and user-friendly web interface.

The application is designed for educational purposes, helping beginners understand how Flask works with HTML templates and a database (MongoDB) to build dynamic web applications.

 Objectives

To understand Flask routing and template rendering

To perform CRUD operations using a web interface

To integrate Flask with MongoDB

To build a structured and maintainable web application

 How the Application Works

The home page displays all student records fetched from MongoDB.

Users can add new students using the "Add Student" form.

Existing student details can be updated using the "Edit" option.

Student records can be permanently removed using the "Delete" option.

All operations are handled through Flask routes connected to MongoDB.
